// the assignment problem is a fundamental combinatorial optimization problem
// that seeks to find the optimal way to assign a set of tasks to a set of agents
// in a way that minimizes the total cost or maximizes the total profit.
// This problem can be solved using various algorithms, including the Hungarian algorithm,
// the Kuhn-Munkres algorithm, and the Auction algorithm.
// In this implementation, we will use the Hungarian algorithm.
