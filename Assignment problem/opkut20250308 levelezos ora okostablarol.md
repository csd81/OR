min = 15

Here, the selected positions:

(0,1), (1,0), (2,4), (3,3), (4,1), (5,5)

Total cost = 15, which is shown as the minimum.

cost matrix after row and/or column reductions:

[ 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 2 ]
[ 0, 3, 2, 6, 4, 5 ]
[ 1, 3, 2, 7, 0, 3 ]
[ 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2 ]
[ 0, 0, 0, 7, 5, 3 ]
[ 7, 6, 5, 1, 0, 2 ]




This image shows a **Hungarian Algorithm step** ‚Äî specifically the **step where we cover all the zeros** with the **minimum number of lines** to check for optimality.

### üîç Here's what happened:

#### ‚úÖ **Matrix Context**

It‚Äôs the same 6√ó6 cost matrix from before:

```
[ 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 2 ]
[ 0, 3, 2, 6, 4, 5 ]
[ 1, 3, 2, 7, 0, 3 ]
[ 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2 ]
[ 0, 0, 0, 7, 5, 1 ]
[ 7, 6, 5, 1, 0, 2 ]
```

---

 

 

In the Hungarian Algorithm:

1. After subtracting row and column minimums, we attempt to assign zeros.
2. If **n (matrix size) lines** are needed to cover all zeros (here n = 6), an optimal assignment is possible.
3. If **more than 6 lines** are required (like here, 7 lines), then we **modify the matrix** by:

   * Finding the **smallest uncovered value**.
   * Subtracting it from all **uncovered elements**.
   * Adding it to all **intersections of covering lines**.
   * Then repeat the zero covering process.

### üß© What's Happening Here:

You are **finding a new set of independent zeros (assignment candidates)** in the matrix after matrix adjustment.

### üî¢ Matrix (from image):

Here is the 6√ó6 matrix written cleanly:
