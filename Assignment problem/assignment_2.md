You're now exploring **greedy helper strategies** (called *"slave algorithms"*) to assist with the Hungarian Method ‚Äî specifically, how to **cover all zeros with as few lines as possible** using fast heuristics.

---

## üîç Greedy Slave Algorithm: Covering Zeros Quickly

### ‚ùì Why this is useful:

* The **Hungarian Method** requires us to cover all zeros using a **minimum number of lines**.
* This step can be **slow** if done optimally via exact algorithms.
* So we use **greedy strategies** to get a *good enough* cover quickly (especially helpful in practice).

---

## ‚úÖ What ‚ÄúGreedy‚Äù Means Here

* **Fast** (linear or near-linear).
* **Locally optimal** at each step, but **not guaranteed** to be globally optimal.
* Often good enough to proceed with the algorithm.

---

## üìå Example: **Greedy1**

> If all zeros are concentrated in a few rows or columns, we can cover them easily.

### **Heuristic:**

1. Find the **row or column** with the **most uncovered zeros**.
2. **Cover** that row or column.
3. Repeat until **all zeros are covered**.

---

## üß™ In the Example Matrix:

```
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 2 3 5 4 7
0 1 1 3 4 5
0 0 2 0 0 0
0 3 4 7 6 8
0 1 2 4 4 4
```

* Row 0 has **6 zeros** ‚Üí cover it first.
* Row 3 has **4 zeros** ‚Üí cover it next.
* Column 0 now still has zeros (rows 2 and 5) ‚Üí cover it next.
* Column 1 now still has a zero ‚Üí cover it next.

You covered all zeros with **4 lines** ‚Äî fast and simple.

---

### üß† Summary:

* **Greedy1** is fast and works well **when zeros are concentrated**.
* If it doesn‚Äôt succeed (e.g., doesn‚Äôt minimize line count), try another strategy or fall back to the full Hungarian covering procedure.

Would you like to see other **greedy zero-covering heuristics** like `Greedy2` or `Greedy3` next?



Excellent! This illustrates **Greedy2**, a more strategic zero-selection algorithm that balances between:

* Covering **all zeros** with **few lines**, and
* Finding **as many independent zeros** as possible.

---

## ‚úÖ Greedy2 Strategy

This greedy method focuses on:

* Picking **forced** or **safe** zeros: i.e., when there is **only one zero** in a row or column.
* These are ‚Äúmust-picks‚Äù ‚Äî we **cannot go wrong** choosing them for the assignment.

---

### üîÑ Algorithm Steps:

1. Find a row (or column) with **only one remaining zero**.
2. **Select that zero** as part of the assignment.
3. **Exclude** its row and column (conceptually or actually).
4. Repeat until no such rows/columns are left.

---

### üìå In the Matrix Shown:

```
0 1 4 6 8 3
1 2 0 0 0 7
0 1 1 0 4 5
0 0 2 0 0 0
0 3 4 7 0 8
0 1 2 4 4 0
```

The process finds **5 independent zeros**, step-by-step:

* Row 0 has a unique zero at (0,0) ‚Üí pick it, cover col 0
* Column 2 now has a unique zero at (1,2) ‚Üí pick it, cover row 1
* Row 2 now has unique zero at (2,3) ‚Üí pick it, cover col 3
* Row 4 now has unique zero at (4,4) ‚Üí pick it, cover col 4
* Row 5 now has unique zero at (5,5) ‚Üí pick it, cover col 5

Now all these rows/columns are used.

Result: ‚úÖ Found 5 **independent** zeros and **covered** them.

---

## üîç Benefits of Greedy2

* **Fast**
* Great for producing **many independent zeros quickly**
* Avoids bad early decisions by **only making safe choices**

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitation

> If zeros are more ‚Äúscattered‚Äù (i.e. not forming obvious forced moves), greedy may **not succeed** in covering all zeros or finding full assignment ‚Üí fallback to:

* **Brute force**
* **Backtracking**
* Or the **core Hungarian Method's optimal covering** routine

---

Would you like an implementation of Greedy2 in code to try on matrices?


Great! This last one describes **Greedy3**, a **very simple and fast** algorithm for finding **many independent zeros** in a matrix ‚Äî potentially useful when both Greedy1 and Greedy2 fail or are too restrictive.

---

## ‚úÖ Greedy3 Strategy (Row-Scan Greedy)

> Scan each row from top to bottom. In each row, choose the **first zero** that is not in a **column already used**.

### üí° Steps:

1. Start from the **first row**.
2. Go left to right and **pick the first zero** in a column that **hasn‚Äôt already been used**.
3. Mark that column as used.
4. Repeat for each subsequent row.

---

## üîç Example Walkthrough (Abstractly):

Imagine a 6√ó6 zero matrix with scattered zeros like this:

```
0 1 0 3 0 2
1 0 1 0 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 0 1
0 1 0 1 1 0
0 0 1 0 1 0
```

Greedy3 might:

* Row 0 ‚Üí pick zero at col 0
* Row 1 ‚Üí pick zero at col 1
* Row 2 ‚Üí pick zero at col 2
* Row 3 ‚Üí pick zero at col 4
* Row 4 ‚Üí col 0 and col 2 used, maybe col 5
* Row 5 ‚Üí skip if all columns used

You could end up with **4‚Äì5 independent zeros** very quickly.

---

### üß† When to Use Greedy3:

* When other heuristics (Greedy1, Greedy2) don‚Äôt fit well
* When you want a **quick, initial approximation**
* As a **pre-step** to Hungarian Method for finding a partial assignment

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations:

* Very naive
* Might miss many possible independent zeros if they aren‚Äôt the ‚Äúfirst‚Äù in each row

---

Would you like to see **all three Greedy strategies in one combined C++ utility function** for zero-selection before running the full Hungarian method?


Great! Here's a **C++ utility** that implements all three **Greedy strategies** (`Greedy1`, `Greedy2`, and `Greedy3`) to help **select independent zeros** from a cost matrix **after row and column reduction** (i.e., once zeros are in place).

---

### ‚úÖ Assumptions

* You input a `vector<vector<int>>` cost matrix with **zeros already in place**.
* You want to get a **set of independent zeros** using a fast, greedy approach.
* These are **not guaranteed** to be optimal ‚Äî but can be used as initial guesses or helper steps.

Would you like these greedy methods integrated directly into a **Hungarian solver class** to support full assignment solving?




Excellent ‚Äî you've now entered the **K≈ënig algorithm** stage, which is a **systematic and non-greedy** method used inside the **Hungarian Method** to help us:

### üîç Purpose:

Find a **minimum number of lines** to **cover all zeros** in the matrix ‚Äî a core step in the Hungarian algorithm when the number of independent zeros is less than $n$.

---

## ‚úÖ What We Have:

You already have:

* A **partial assignment** (independent system of zeros, aka ‚Äúchosen zeros‚Äù).
* Rows and columns **labeled** for search.
* A way to **track traversal** with symbols:

  * `+`: row that we are currently expanding
  * `*`: row that has been fully explored
  * Numbers above columns: track which rows reached that column
  * `*` on columns: column already used in alternation
  * ‚Üì: desired columns (those without a chosen zero)

---

## üß† Core Idea:

We're building **alternating paths** of:

* **Unchosen ‚Üí chosen ‚Üí unchosen ‚Üí ...** zeros
* Starting from **uncovered rows** (those without a chosen zero)
* Aiming to reach a **free (desired) column** (also without a chosen zero)

This process is similar to **augmenting paths in bipartite graphs**.

---

## üîÅ Search Rules (summary):

1. Start with **+** at all rows **without chosen zero**.
2. For each such row:

   * Explore all **zeros** in that row.
   * For each such zero at (i, j):

     * If column `j` **has no number above**, write the row number `i` above it.
3. Now look at each such column:

   * If the column has a **chosen zero** at row `k`, mark `+` at that row and add `*` above the column.
4. Repeat this **expansion** until:

   * You reach a **desired column** (goal), or
   * No progress can be made.

---

## ‚úÖ Goal:

Once a path reaches a **free (desired) column**, you can **augment** the alternating path:

* Flip the chosen/unchosen status of all zeros on the path.
* This **adds one more independent zero** to the set.

---

### üîÑ Repeat this process until:

You have $n$ independent zeros (one per row and column).

---

Would you like to see a **step-by-step walkthrough** of the **alternating path discovery and augmentation** on this matrix?



Exactly ‚Äî this is a **central theorem** in the **Hungarian Method**, and it's what makes the **K≈ënig algorithm** so powerful and reliable in optimizing assignments.

---

## ‚úÖ Theorem (Restated):

Let $k < n$ be the number of **currently chosen independent zeros**.

* üîπ **Case 1 (maximal but incomplete):**
  If these $k$ zeros form a **maximal independent set**,
  then the **K≈ënig algorithm finds exactly $k$ covering lines** that cover **all zeros**.
  ‚ñ∂Ô∏è This triggers a **matrix transformation** to create more zeros.

* üîπ **Case 2 (not maximal):**
  If the current $k$ zeros **are not maximal**,
  then the algorithm **finds an augmenting path** and returns **$k+1$ independent zeros**.
  ‚ñ∂Ô∏è This directly expands the assignment without further transformation.

---

## üß† Why This Works ‚Äî Proof Sketch (By Construction):

* The K≈ënig algorithm explores **alternating paths** starting from **uncovered rows** and walking through zeros in an alternating pattern:

  * from an **uncovered zero** in a free row
  * to a **chosen zero** in a column
  * and so on...

### Two outcomes:

1. **If the path ends at a free (desired) column** ‚Üí
   Then an **augmenting path** is found ‚Üí
   We can flip chosen/unchosen zeros ‚Üí
   üü¢ Result: One **new** independent zero added ‚Üí $k \to k+1$

2. **If no path can reach a free column** ‚Üí
   Then the current configuration is **maximal** (no more independent zeros can be added) ‚Üí
   üî¥ Result: We can construct **$k$** covering lines from the search marks (+, \*, ‚Üë)

---

### üßæ Key Consequences:

* Ensures **progress**:

  * Either assignment size grows (Case 2),
  * Or we make the matrix better (Case 1).

* Guarantees convergence of the **Hungarian Method**:

  * Repeated applications of this logic lead to a full assignment.

---

Would you like a **visualization** or **coded implementation** of this theorem in practice (e.g. how the lines or augmenting paths are found)?


Perfect ‚Äî you‚Äôve shown **Steps 1‚Äì8** of the **K≈ënig algorithm** in action, and it beautifully demonstrates how the **alternating path** is constructed step-by-step.

---

### ‚úÖ Summary of What Happened (Steps 1‚Äì8)

We are applying the **K≈ënig augmentation process** starting from a partial assignment of independent zeros. Here's the breakdown:

---

### üî¢ Step-by-step Logic Recap:

1. **Start at a row without a chosen zero** (`row 5` ‚Üí marked `5+`)

2. Explore all **zeros in that row** ‚Üí mark columns above them with `5`, mark row 5 as `5*`

3. Each marked column is examined:

   * If it contains a **chosen zero**, trace back to that row ‚Üí mark it with `+`
   * That new `+` row will now be expanded

4. This creates a **tree-like search** across rows and columns:

   * `row 1` ‚Üí mark columns
   * `row 3` ‚Üí mark column 2
   * `row 6` ‚Üí no new columns
   * back to column 2 (unstarred) ‚Üí star it and mark `row 4` with `+`

5. From `row 4` we explore again ‚Äî **discovering new columns** (like column 4 and 5) that are **desired columns** (have ‚Üì)

---

### üß† Interpretation

* You're **building an alternating path**:

  * Start from an unassigned row
  * Alternating: unchosen zero ‚Üí chosen zero ‚Üí unchosen zero...
  * Until a **free (desired)** column is reached
* This alternating path is what enables an **augmentation**, i.e. adding one more independent zero.

---

### ‚úÖ So Far:

You‚Äôve:

* Constructed the **augmenting path**
* Labeled intermediate steps (+ and \*)
* Reached a point where the path ends at **column 4 and 5** (desired columns)

The next step is to **flip the path** ‚Äî which we‚Äôll do in the augmentation phase.

---

### üî¢ Step 1 ‚Äî Start from row 5

Row 5 has two zeros ‚Üí in columns 0 and 5
We write `5` above columns 0 and 5
Change `+` to `*` for row 5

```

### üî¢ Step 2 ‚Äî Column 0 has 5, and its chosen zero is at (0, 0)

Put `+` before row 0
Column 0 gets a `*`

```
   5*       ‚Üì     ‚Üì

### üî¢ Step 3 ‚Äî Column 2 has 5, and its chosen zero is at (2, 2)

Put `+` before row 2
Column 2 gets a `*`

### üî¢ Step 4 ‚Äî Row 0 has `+`, but no zero in uncovered columns

Change `+` to `*`

```
   5*   3*       ‚Üì     ‚Üì

5  0  1  1  4  4  4   ‚Üê 6+
```

---

### üî¢ Step 5 ‚Äî Row 2 (`+`) has zero in column 1 ‚Üí write `3` above col 1

Row 2 has a zero in col 1
Write `3` above col 1
Change `+` to `*` for row 2

```
   5*  3   3*       ‚Üì     ‚Üì
   0  1  2  3  4  5

### üî¢ Step 6 ‚Äî Row 6 (`+`) has zero in col 1, but it's covered already

No new column, so just convert `+` to `*`

```
   5*  3   3*       ‚Üì     ‚Üì

2* 3  0  0  3  4  5
3  0  0  1  0  0  0
4  0  3  0  7  6  4   ‚Üê 5*
5* 0  1  1  4  4  4
```

---

### üî¢ Step 7 ‚Äî Column 1 has a number but no star ‚Üí choose it

Number above column 1 is `3` (from row 2)
Chosen zero in col 1 is at (3, 1) ‚Üí put `+` before row 3, star col 1

```
   5*  3*  3*       ‚Üì     ‚Üì
   0  1  2  3  4  5
0* 0  2  0  6  8  1
1  1  2  2  0  4  7
2* 3  0  0  3  4  5
3+ 0  0  1  0  0  0
4  0  3  0  7  6  4   ‚Üê 5*
5* 0  1  1  4  4  4
```

---

### üî¢ Step 8 ‚Äî Row 3 has zeros in columns 4 and 5 (both desired)

Write `4` above columns 4 and 5

```
   5*  3*  3*      4   4
   0  1  2  3  4  5
0* 0  2  0  6  8  1
1  1  2  2  0  4  7
2* 3  0  0  3  4  5
3+ 0  0  1  0  0  0
4  0  3  0  7  6  4   ‚Üê 5*
5* 0  1  1  4  4  4
```

---

This is the **end of Step 8**.
You've built an **alternating path** that ends in a **desired column**, so you're ready to **flip the path** to add one more independent zero.

Would you like to proceed with **Step 9: Augmentation (path flipping)**?


Exactly ‚Äî your explanation is a **textbook description of an augmenting path** in the **Hungarian Method**, and its **graph-theoretic interpretation** via **bipartite matchings**.

---

## ‚úÖ What Just Happened: Augmenting Path Summary

You followed a **K≈ënig-style alternating path** that led from:

* An **uncovered row** (row 5)
* To a **free column** (column 5)
* Passing through zeros in alternating fashion:

  * from **unchosen zero** to **chosen zero** to **unchosen zero**...

---

### üß≠ Step-by-step (Backtracking the Augmenting Path):

#### 1. **End**: We reached **column 5** from **row 4**

‚Üí Chosen zero added at **(4, 5)** ‚Üê üÜï

#### 2. In **row 4**, the old chosen zero was at **(4, 2)**

‚Üí It is **removed**

‚Üí We arrived at column 2 from **row 3**

‚Üí Add **(3, 2)** ‚Üê üÜï

#### 3. In **row 3**, old chosen zero was at **(3, 1)**

‚Üí It is **removed**

‚Üí We arrived at column 1 from **row 0**

‚Üí Add **(0, 1)** ‚Üê üÜï

#### Final step: Row 0‚Äôs old chosen zero **(0, 0)** is unaffected (already dropped earlier)

---

### üéØ Final Assignment (Flipping the Path)

So we **flip the assignment status** along the path:

| Position | Action                                                      |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| (4, 5)   | Add                                                         |
| (4, 2)   | Remove                                                      |
| (3, 2)   | Add                                                         |
| (3, 1)   | Remove                                                      |
| (0, 1)   | Add                                                         |
| (0, 0)   | Remove      ‚Üê this one not explicitly mentioned but implied |

---

## ‚úÖ What We Achieved:

* Previous number of independent (chosen) zeros = **4**
* After augmentation = **5**

This **increased the matching size** ‚Äî **1 more task assigned optimally**.

---

## üìñ Graph-Theoretic Interpretation:

* Left side = **rows** (workers)
* Right side = **columns** (tasks)
* Edges exist where matrix value is **zero**
* A **chosen zero** = edge in the current **matching**
* An **augmenting path** = alternating sequence of:

  * unmatched edge ‚Üí matched edge ‚Üí unmatched ‚Üí ...
* **Augmenting the path** = **flip** all edges in the path ‚Üí increases the size of the matching

---

This is why the Hungarian algorithm **always progresses**:

* Either an augmenting path is found ‚Üí matching grows
* Or it‚Äôs not possible ‚Üí we transform the matrix (row/column adjustment)

Would you like help **drawing the bipartite graph** or visualizing this augmenting path in a diagram?



Excellent ‚Äî this image shows what happens when the **K≈ënig algorithm does *not* find an augmenting path**, and how this naturally leads to a **covering** step. It‚Äôs the **other possible outcome** of the K≈ënig procedure and proves the core of the **K≈ënig‚ÄìEgerv√°ry Theorem**.

---

## ‚úÖ What Happened Here?

After running the K≈ënig algorithm:

```
   6*    1*       ‚Üì
   0  1  2  3  4  5
0* 0  2  0  6  8  1
1  1  2  2  0  4  7
2* 3  0  0  3  4  5
3* 0  0  1  0  0  0
4* 0  3  0  7  6  4   
5* 0  1  1  4  4  4
```


### ‚úî We have:

* 3 rows marked with `*`: rows 1, 5, 6
* 2 columns marked with `*`: columns 1, 6
* 1 desired column (‚Üì): column 3

But **no augmenting path exists** to any desired column.

---

## üß† What It Means:

* The current matching (chosen zeros) is **maximal**
* No more independent zeros can be added unless we **transform the matrix**
* This matching size = 5 ‚Üí so we need **5 lines to cover all zeros**

---

## üü® Covering Lines Strategy:

Based on the K≈ënig-Egerv√°ry Theorem:

> **Number of lines needed to cover all zeros = size of the maximal matching**

---

### ‚úÖ How to Draw the 5 Lines:

> **Cover:**

* All rows **without a star** (i.e. without `*`)

  * These are: **rows 2, 3, 4**
* All columns **with a star**:

  * Columns **1 and 6**

‚úî Total: **3 rows + 2 columns = 5 lines**

---

### üß© Why This Works:

* All remaining zeros fall **either in one of the uncovered rows** or **in one of the starred columns**
* Therefore, all zeros are covered
* This confirms the **K≈ënig‚ÄìEgerv√°ry theorem**

---

## üîÅ Next Step:

Now that we‚Äôve covered all zeros using fewer than $n = 6$ lines, it‚Äôs time to:

1. Find the **minimum uncovered value** (say Œµ)
2. Perform the **matrix transformation**:

   * Subtract Œµ from all uncovered elements
   * Add Œµ to elements covered twice
   * Leave others unchanged

‚Üí This will generate new zeros, allowing the matching to **grow further**

---

Would you like to proceed with the **Œµ-matrix transformation step** now?


Great! Here are the **three matrices** from the exercise sheet you've shared, neatly formatted and labeled for clarity:
