### **3. Production Model and Simplex Example**

* A production problem is introduced with 5 products (P1 to P5) and 3 resource constraints (Res1, Res2, Res3).
* The goal is to maximize profit while adhering to resource capacities.

### **4. Objective Function and Constraints**

* The linear programming problem is mathematically defined:

  * Objective: Maximize $z = 19x_1 + 23x_2 + 15x_3 + 42x_4 + 33x_5$
  * Subject to:

    * $x_1 + 2x_2 + x_3 + 3x_4 \leq 24$
    * $x_2 + x_3 + 5x_4 + x_5 \leq 43$
    * $x_1 + 2x_4 + 2x_5 \leq 18$
    * $x_i \geq 0$

### **5. Simplex Method Steps**

* Slack variables $s_1$, $s_2$, and $s_3$ are introduced to convert inequalities into equations.
* The Simplex tableau is formed to facilitate iterative optimization.
* The pivoting process is applied based on the "minimum rule," ensuring feasibility and improvement of the objective.

### **6. Optimal Solution**

* The final optimal solution is achieved:

  * $x_3 = 24$, $x_5 = 9$, $z_{\text{opt}} = 657$
  * This indicates producing 24 units of product P3 and 9 units of P5 yields the highest profit of 657 while respecting all resource constraints.

### **7. Conclusion and Observations**

* The lecture emphasizes:

  * Primal feasibility ($x \geq 0$)
  * Dual feasibility (no negative reduced costs)
  * Optimality is achieved when both conditions hold.

### **8. Practical Implications**

* The lecture suggests practicing several exercises to master the Simplex Method.
* It highlights how the greedy approach can sometimes guess the solution but cannot replace systematic methods like Simplex.

Slide **4/22** of the document, titled **"A Production Model and the Primal Simplex Method,"** introduces a specific linear programming problem related to production planning. Here's a breakdown of the content:

### **Production Problem:**

* The problem involves a small factory producing five products: **P1, P2, P3, P4,** and **P5**.
* The production process is constrained by three resources: **Res1, Res2,** and **Res3**.

### **Data Table:**

The slide presents the following production data:

|        | P1 | P2 | P3 | P4 | P5 | Capacity (Cap) |
| ------ | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -------------- |
| Res1   | 1  | 2  | 1  | 3  | 0  | 24             |
| Res2   | 0  | 1  | 1  | 5  | 1  | 43             |
| Res3   | 1  | 0  | 0  | 2  | 2  | 18             |
| Profit | 19 | 23 | 15 | 42 | 33 |                |

### **Explanation:**

* **Columns:** Represent the products (P1 to P5).
* **Rows:** Represent the resource constraints (Res1, Res2, and Res3).
* **Profit row:** Shows the profit per unit for each product.

For example:

* **Product P4** requires 3 units of Res1, 5 units of Res2, and 2 units of Res3. It generates **42 units of profit** per unit produced.
* The **capacity constraints** (Cap) indicate the maximum available units of each resource: 24 for Res1, 43 for Res2, and 18 for Res3.

### **Objective:**

The goal is to find the **optimal production plan** that:

1. Does not exceed the available resource capacities.
2. Maximizes the total profit, calculated as a linear combination of the production quantities and profit coefficients.

Would you like me to demonstrate how the Simplex Method solves this production problem step by step?

----

Slide **5/22** of the document continues with the **Production Model and the Primal Simplex Method**. It presents possible production plans and their corresponding profits based on the given constraints. Here’s the breakdown:

### **Production Plans and Profit Calculations:**

| Scenario | Production Plan $x$    | Profit Calculation $c \cdot x$ | Total Profit $z$ |
| -------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------- |
| (a)      | $x = (18, 0, 0, 0, 0)$ | $18 \times 19$                 | 342              |
| (b)      | $x = (0, 12, 0, 0, 0)$ | $12 \times 23$                 | 276              |
| (c)      | $x = (0, 0, 24, 0, 0)$ | $24 \times 15$                 | 360              |
| (d)      | $x = (0, 0, 0, 8, 0)$  | $8 \times 42$                  | 336              |
| (e)      | $x = (0, 0, 0, 0, 9)$  | $9 \times 33$                  | 297              |
| (f)      | $x = (18, 3, 0, 0, 0)$ | $18 \times 19 + 3 \times 23$   | 411              |
| (g)      | $x = (0, 0, 24, 0, 9)$ | $24 \times 15 + 9 \times 33$   | 657              |

### **Explanation:**

1. Each scenario represents a different production combination.
2. The profit is calculated by multiplying the quantity of each product by its corresponding profit per unit and summing the results.
3. The **best solution** found among these trials is scenario (g), where producing **24 units of P3** and **9 units of P5** yields a maximum profit of **657**.

### **Key Question:**

The slide ends with an open question: **"Is it the best, or does a better solution exist?"** This sets up the need for the Simplex Method, which systematically finds the optimal solution rather than relying on guesses.

Would you like me to explain how the Simplex Method confirms that scenario (g) is indeed the optimal solution?

----
Slide **6/22** of the document focuses on key definitions related to linear programming and the Simplex method. Here’s a breakdown of the content:

### **Key Definitions:**

1. **Solution:**

   * A vector $x$ is called a **solution** if, when substituted into the system of inequalities, all constraints are satisfied.

2. **Feasible Solution:**

   * A vector $x$ is a **feasible solution** if:

     * It satisfies all the constraints of the linear program.
     * All components of $x$ are non-negative ($x \geq 0$).

3. **Optimal Solution:**

   * A vector $x$ is an **optimal solution** if:

     * It is a feasible solution.
     * It maximizes (or minimizes, depending on the problem) the objective function value among all feasible solutions.

---

### **Example Production Problem Recap:**

The production problem table is reiterated:

|        | P1 | P2 | P3 | P4 | P5 | Capacity (Cap) |
| ------ | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -------------- |
| Res1   | 1  | 2  | 1  | 3  | 0  | 24             |
| Res2   | 0  | 1  | 1  | 5  | 1  | 43             |
| Res3   | 1  | 0  | 0  | 2  | 2  | 18             |
| Profit | 19 | 23 | 15 | 42 | 33 |                |

---

### **Examples of Different Solutions:**

1. **Non-feasible Solution:**
   $x = (-1, 1, 1, 1, 1)$

   * It satisfies some constraints but violates the non-negativity condition ($x \geq 0$).

2. **Feasible but not a solution:**
   $x = (10, 10, 0, 0, 0)$

   * It satisfies non-negativity but does not meet all constraints.

3. **Feasible Solution:**
   $x = (5, 1, 1, 0, 0)$

   * It satisfies all constraints and non-negativity conditions.

---

### **Key Insight:**

At this stage, the lecture highlights that although some feasible solutions exist, the **optimal solution** has not yet been confirmed. The next steps involve using the **Simplex Method** to identify the best production plan systematically.

Would you like a step-by-step explanation of how the Simplex Method identifies the optimal solution from these feasible solutions?

Slide **8/22** focuses on the process of finding feasible and optimal solutions for a linear programming problem. Here's a detailed breakdown of the content:

---

### **Key Questions:**

1. **Is there an optimal solution at all?**

   * It’s not guaranteed that every linear programming problem has an optimal solution. The feasibility and boundedness of the problem determine this.

2. **If yes, how many optimal solutions exist?**

   * There can be:

     * **One unique optimal solution**
     * **Multiple optimal solutions** if the objective function is parallel to a constraint boundary.
     * **No optimal solution** if the feasible region is unbounded or infeasible.

3. **How do we find the optimal solution?**

   * Several methods can be used, including:

     * **Graphical Method** (for two-variable problems)
     * **Simplex Method** (suitable for higher dimensions)
     * **Interior Point Methods** (used for large-scale problems)

---

### **Primal Simplex Method:**

* The slide highlights the **Primal Simplex Method** as a systematic approach to find the optimal solution.
* This method iteratively improves the objective function value while maintaining feasibility until the optimal solution is reached.

---

### **Mid-Test Exercise:**

* The slide notes that understanding and applying the **Primal Simplex Method** will be essential for the **first exercise in the mid-test**. This emphasizes its importance in both theoretical understanding and practical application.

---

Would you like me to walk you through the steps of the Primal Simplex Method using the production example from earlier slides? I can also explain how it determines feasibility and optimality.



Let's walk through the **Primal Simplex Method** step by step, using the production example provided in the lecture. The objective is to maximize profit while satisfying resource constraints.

---

## 📝 **1. Problem Setup:**

### **Decision Variables:**

Let $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5$ represent the quantities of products P1, P2, P3, P4, and P5 to produce.

### **Objective Function:**

Maximize profit:

$$
z = 19x_1 + 23x_2 + 15x_3 + 42x_4 + 33x_5
$$

### **Constraints (Resource Limits):**

$$
\begin{cases}
x_1 + 2x_2 + x_3 + 3x_4 \leq 24 \quad (\text{Res1})\\
x_2 + x_3 + 5x_4 + x_5 \leq 43 \quad (\text{Res2})\\
x_1 + 2x_4 + 2x_5 \leq 18 \quad (\text{Res3})\\
x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5 \geq 0
\end{cases}
$$

---

## ⚙️ **2. Convert Inequalities to Equalities:**

Add **slack variables** $s_1, s_2, s_3$ to convert inequalities into equations:

$$
\begin{cases}
x_1 + 2x_2 + x_3 + 3x_4 + s_1 = 24 \\
x_2 + x_3 + 5x_4 + x_5 + s_2 = 43 \\
x_1 + 2x_4 + 2x_5 + s_3 = 18
\end{cases}
$$

---

## 📊 **3. Initial Simplex Tableau:**

| **B** | $x_B$ | $x_1$ | $x_2$ | $x_3$ | $x_4$ | $x_5$ | $s_1$ | $s_2$ | $s_3$ | $z$ |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | --- |
| $s_1$ | 24    | 1     | 2     | 1     | 3     | 0     | 1     | 0     | 0     | 0   |
| $s_2$ | 43    | 0     | 1     | 1     | 5     | 1     | 0     | 1     | 0     | 0   |
| $s_3$ | 18    | 1     | 0     | 0     | 2     | 2     | 0     | 0     | 1     | 0   |
| $z$   | 0     | -19   | -23   | -15   | -42   | -33   | 0     | 0     | 0     | 0   |

* **Basic variables (B):** $s_1, s_2, s_3$
* **Objective row (z):** Shows the reduced costs.
* **Initial solution:** $x_1 = 0, x_2 = 0, x_3 = 0, x_4 = 0, x_5 = 0$, slack variables at capacity: $s_1 = 24, s_2 = 43, s_3 = 18$.

---

## 🔑 **4. Identify Entering and Leaving Variables:**

* **Entering Variable:** Choose the most negative reduced cost in the $z$-row.

  * Here, $-42$ (corresponding to $x_4$) is the most negative.
  * Thus, **$x_4$ enters the basis.**

* **Leaving Variable:** Apply the **minimum ratio rule**:

$$
\text{min} \left(\frac{24}{3}, \frac{43}{5}, \frac{18}{2}\right)
$$

* $24/3 = 8, \quad 43/5 = 8.6, \quad 18/2 = 9$
* The smallest ratio is **8**, so **$s_1$ leaves the basis.**

---

## 🔄 **5. Perform Pivoting (Basis Transformation):**

* **Pivot element:** The intersection of the entering column ($x_4$) and the leaving row ($s_1$), which is **3**.
* **Normalize the pivot row:** Divide Row 1 by 3.

Update the tableau after pivoting, adjusting all other rows accordingly.

---

## 📈 **6. Check for Optimality:**

After several iterations of the same process:

* The final tableau shows **no negative reduced costs** in the last row.
* The **optimal solution** is reached with:

$$
x_3 = 24, \quad x_5 = 9, \quad z_{\text{opt}} = 657
$$

This means producing **24 units of product P3** and **9 units of product P5** maximizes the profit while respecting all constraints.

---

## ✅ **7. Conclusion:**

* **Optimal Production Plan:**

  * Produce 24 units of **P3** and 9 units of **P5**.
  * Do not produce **P1, P2,** or **P4**.

* **Remaining Resources:**

  * 10 units of **Res2** remain unused, while **Res1** and **Res3** are fully utilized.

* **Maximum Profit:**

$$
z_{\text{opt}} = 657
$$

x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5 \geq 0
\end{cases}
$$

---

## **2. Convert Inequalities to Equalities:**

Add **slack variables** $s_1, s_2, s_3$ for each constraint:

$$
\begin{cases}
x_1 + 2x_2 + x_3 + 3x_4 + s_1 = 24 \\
x_2 + x_3 + 5x_4 + x_5 + s_2 = 43 \\

The **Simplex Method** is an algorithm used to solve linear programming problems, particularly for maximizing or minimizing an objective function subject to linear constraints. It works by iteratively improving the solution until the optimal solution is reached.

Let's break down the method step by step for clarity:

---

## **🔍 1. Problem Formulation:**

Start with a linear programming problem in standard form:

### **Objective Function:**

Maximize (or minimize):

$$
z = c_1 x_1 + c_2 x_2 + \dots + c_n x_n
$$

### **Subject to Constraints:**

$$
\begin{cases}
a_{11} x_1 + a_{12} x_2 + \dots + a_{1n} x_n \leq b_1 \\
a_{21} x_1 + a_{22} x_2 + \dots + a_{2n} x_n \leq b_2 \\
\vdots \\
a_{m1} x_1 + a_{m2} x_2 + \dots + a_{mn} x_n \leq b_m
\end{cases}
$$

With non-negativity conditions:

$$
x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n \geq 0
$$

---

## **📝 2. Convert to Standard Form:**

To convert inequalities into equalities, introduce **slack variables**:

For each constraint $a_{11} x_1 + a_{12} x_2 + \dots + a_{1n} x_n \leq b_1$, add a slack variable $s_1$:

$$
a_{11} x_1 + a_{12} x_2 + \dots + a_{1n} x_n + s_1 = b_1
$$

Thus, the problem becomes:

* **Maximize:** $z = c_1 x_1 + c_2 x_2 + \dots + c_n x_n$
* **Subject to:**

$$
\begin{cases}
a_{11} x_1 + a_{12} x_2 + \dots + a_{1n} x_n + s_1 = b_1 \\
a_{21} x_1 + a_{22} x_2 + \dots + a_{2n} x_n + s_2 = b_2 \\
\vdots
\end{cases}
$$

* $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n, s_1, s_2, \dots \geq 0$.

---

## **📊 3. Set Up Initial Simplex Tableau:**

Create the initial tableau with the following structure:

| **B (Basic Variables)** | **RHS (x\_B)** | $x_1$    | $x_2$    | $\dots$ | $s_1$ | $s_2$ | **z-row (Reduced Cost)** |
| ----------------------- | -------------- | -------- | -------- | ------- | ----- | ----- | ------------------------ |
| $s_1$                   | $b_1$          | $a_{11}$ | $a_{12}$ | $\dots$ | 1     | 0     | 0                        |
| $s_2$                   | $b_2$          | $a_{21}$ | $a_{22}$ | $\dots$ | 0     | 1     | 0                        |
| $z$                     | 0              | $-c_1$   | $-c_2$   | $\dots$ | 0     | 0     | 1                        |

---

## **🔑 4. Iterative Steps:**

**Step 1: Identify Entering Variable (Pivot Column):**

* Look at the **z-row (reduced costs)**.
* Choose the **most negative value** as the entering variable.
* This indicates the direction for improving the objective function.

**Step 2: Identify Leaving Variable (Pivot Row):**

* Apply the **minimum ratio test**:

$$
\text{Ratio} = \frac{\text{RHS}}{\text{Coefficient of entering variable}}
$$

* Choose the **smallest positive ratio**.
* This ensures the solution remains feasible.

**Step 3: Perform Pivoting:**

* Normalize the pivot row by dividing by the pivot element.
* Adjust the other rows to make the pivot column zero.
* Update the tableau accordingly.

**Step 4: Check Optimality:**

* If there are **no negative values** in the z-row, the current solution is **optimal**.
* Otherwise, repeat the process with the new tableau.

---

## **✅ 5. Optimal Solution:**

Once the z-row has no negative entries:

* **Basic Variables (B):** These represent the current solution.
* **RHS Column (x\_B):** This shows the values of the decision variables.
* **Objective Value:** The value in the z-row represents the **maximum profit (or minimum cost)**.

---

## **💡 6. Special Cases:**

1. **Unbounded Solution:** If no positive ratios exist, the objective function can increase indefinitely.
2. **Degeneracy:** If a basic variable has a value of zero, cycling may occur.
3. **Multiple Optimal Solutions:** If a non-basic variable has a zero reduced cost, there are alternative solutions.

---

## **Example Recap (Production Problem):**

| **B** | $x_B$ | $x_1$         | $x_2$ | $x_3$ | $x_4$ | $x_5$ | $s_1$ | $s_2$ | $s_3$         | $z$ |
| ----- | ----- | ------------- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ------------- | --- |
| $x_3$ | 24    | 1             | 2     | 1     | 3     | 0     | 1     | 0     | 0             | 0   |
| $s_2$ | 10    | -1.5          | -1    | 0     | 1     | 0     | -1    | 1     | -0.5          | 0   |
| $x_5$ | 9     | $\frac{1}{2}$ | 0     | 0     | 1     | 1     | 0     | 0     | $\frac{1}{2}$ | 0   |
| $z$   | 657   | 25/2          | 7     | 0     | 36    | 0     | 15    | 0     | 33/2          | 0   |

* **Optimal Solution:** $x_3 = 24$, $x_5 = 9$, $z = 657$.

Would you like a deeper explanation of pivoting, the ratio test, or how the reduced cost works? I can also demonstrate another example if that helps.




Pivoting is a key operation in the **Simplex Method**, where we update the tableau to move toward the optimal solution. It involves transforming the system of equations to maintain feasibility while improving the objective value.

Let's break down the pivoting process step by step:

---

## **🔍 What is Pivoting?**

In the Simplex Method:

* One **non-basic variable enters** the basis (to increase the objective function).
* One **basic variable leaves** the basis (to maintain feasibility).
* The **pivot element** is the intersection of the entering column and the leaving row.

Pivoting transforms the tableau into an equivalent system of equations, where the entering variable becomes basic and the leaving variable becomes non-basic.

---

## **⚙️ Steps in Pivoting:**

### **1. Identify Pivot Column (Entering Variable)**

* Look at the **z-row (reduced costs)**.
* Choose the most negative value (for maximization problems).
* The corresponding column indicates the **entering variable**.

For example, if the $z$-row has:

$$
z = 0 - 19x_1 - 23x_2 - 15x_3 - 42x_4 - 33x_5
$$

The most negative value is **-42**, so $x_4$ enters the basis.

---

### **2. Identify Pivot Row (Leaving Variable)**

* Apply the **Minimum Ratio Test**:

$$
\text{Ratio} = \frac{\text{RHS (current solution)}}{\text{Coefficient of entering variable}}
$$

* Choose the **smallest non-negative ratio**.
* This ensures feasibility after the variable enters the basis.

For example:

| **B** | $x_B$ (RHS) | $x_4$ |
| ----- | ----------- | ----- |
| $s_1$ | 24          | 3     |
| $s_2$ | 43          | 5     |
| $s_3$ | 18          | 2     |

Calculating the ratio:

$$
\frac{24}{3} = 8, \quad \frac{43}{5} = 8.6, \quad \frac{18}{2} = 9
$$

The **smallest ratio is 8**, so **$s_1$ leaves the basis**.

---

### **3. Perform Pivoting (Row Operations)**

Now, transform the tableau to reflect the new basis. The pivot element is **3** (where $x_4$ and $s_1$ intersect).

👉 **Step 1: Normalize Pivot Row:**

* Divide the entire pivot row by the pivot element.

Original Row:

$$
s_1: \quad 1 x_1 + 2 x_2 + 1 x_3 + 3 x_4 + s_1 = 24
$$

Divide by 3:

$$
x_4: \quad \frac{1}{3} x_1 + \frac{2}{3} x_2 + \frac{1}{3} x_3 + 1 x_4 + \frac{1}{3} s_1 = 8
$$

👉 **Step 2: Make Pivot Column Zero in Other Rows:**

* Subtract appropriate multiples of the pivot row from each row to make all other entries in the pivot column zero.

For Row 2 ($s_2$):

$$
s_2 = 43 - 5 \times 8 = 43 - 40 = 3
$$

For Row 3 ($s_3$):

$$
s_3 = 18 - 2 \times 8 = 18 - 16 = 2
$$

For the Objective Row ($z$):

$$
z = 0 - (-42) \times 8 = 336
$$

---

### **4. Update Tableau**

After pivoting, the new tableau looks like this:

| **B** | $x_B$ | $x_1$         | $x_2$         | $x_3$         | $x_4$ | $x_5$ | $s_1$         | $s_2$ | $s_3$ | $z$ |
| ----- | ----- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ----- | ----- | ------------- | ----- | ----- | --- |
| $x_4$ | 8     | $\frac{1}{3}$ | $\frac{2}{3}$ | $\frac{1}{3}$ | 1     | 0     | $\frac{1}{3}$ | 0     | 0     | 0   |
| $s_2$ | 3     | -1.67         | -2.33         | 0.33          | 0     | 1     | -1.67         | 1     | 0     | 0   |
| $s_3$ | 2     | 0.33          | -1.33         | -0.67         | 0     | 2     | -0.33         | 0     | 1     | 0   |
| $z$   | 336   | -5            | -5            | -1            | 0     | -33   | 14            | 0     | 0     | 1   |

---

## **🔄 4. Repeat Until Optimal Solution Reached**

* Identify the next pivot column (most negative in the z-row).
* Perform the ratio test and pivot again.
* Continue until there are no negative values in the z-row.

---

## **📝 Why Does Pivoting Work?**

1. **Feasibility:** Ensures all basic variables remain non-negative.
2. **Optimality:** Each pivot improves the objective value.
3. **Equivalence:** The new system represents the same problem in a different form.

---

## **💡 Key Insights:**

1. **Pivot Element:** Intersection of the entering column and leaving row.
2. **Normalization:** Convert the pivot row so the pivot element equals 1.
3. **Zeroing Out:** Ensure other entries in the pivot column are zero.

x_1 + 2x_4 + 2x_5 + s_3 = 18
\end{cases}

$$

Slide **11/22** explains the first step of solving the linear programming problem using the **Simplex Method** by converting inequalities into equations through **slack variables**. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

---

## **🔍 1. Original Constraints (Inequalities):**

The given resource constraints are:

$$
\begin{cases}
x_1 + 2x_2 + x_3 + 3x_4 \leq 24 \quad (\text{Resource 1}) \\
x_2 + x_3 + 5x_4 + x_5 \leq 43 \quad (\text{Resource 2}) \\
x_1 + 2x_4 + 2x_5 \leq 18 \quad (\text{Resource 3})
\end{cases}
$$

---

## **⚙️ 2. Introduce Slack Variables:**

To convert the inequalities into equalities, introduce **slack variables** $s_1$, $s_2$, and $s_3$:

* $s_1$: Unused capacity of Resource 1.
* $s_2$: Unused capacity of Resource 2.
* $s_3$: Unused capacity of Resource 3.

The constraints become:

$$
\begin{cases}
x_1 + 2x_2 + x_3 + 3x_4 + s_1 = 24 \\
x_2 + x_3 + 5x_4 + x_5 + s_2 = 43 \\
x_1 + 2x_4 + 2x_5 + s_3 = 18
\end{cases}
$$

**Non-negativity conditions:**

$$
x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5, s_1, s_2, s_3 \geq 0
$$

---

## **📊 3. Objective Function (Profit):**

Maximize:

$$
z = 19x_1 + 23x_2 + 15x_3 + 42x_4 + 33x_5
$$

Rewrite as:

$$
19x_1 + 23x_2 + 15x_3 + 42x_4 + 33x_5 - z = 0
$$

Would you like me to walk through the next iterations of the Simplex Method using this tableau?



Slide **13/22** presents a crucial theorem that guides the decision-making process in the Simplex Method. This theorem determines when an optimal solution is reached or whether further iterations are needed.

---

## **🔑 Theorem (Simplex Optimality Conditions):**

**Exactly one** of the following three cases must occur at each iteration:

1. **Case A: Optimal Solution Found**

   * There are **no negative entries** in the last row (z-row).
   * The corresponding basic solution is **optimal**.
   * This means the current solution cannot be improved further while maintaining feasibility.

2. **Case B: Unbounded Solution**

   * There is a **negative value** in the z-row, and **no positive value** in its corresponding column.
   * This indicates that the objective value can increase indefinitely.
   * The problem has an **unbounded solution**.

3. **Case C: Continue Iteration**

   * There is a **negative value** in the z-row, and there exists at least **one positive value** in the corresponding column.
   * In this case, we perform a **basis transformation (pivoting)**.
   * This transformation improves the objective value without violating feasibility.

---

## **⚙️ How to Apply the Theorem:**

1. **Check the z-row:**
   Look at the coefficients in the objective row.

   * If all are non-negative → **Stop, optimal solution found**.
   * If any are negative → **Choose the most negative as the entering variable.**

2. **Perform the Minimum Ratio Test:**
   For the entering variable, calculate the ratio:

   $$
   \text{Ratio} = \frac{\text{RHS (x_B)}}{\text{Coefficient of entering variable}}
   $$

   * Choose the **smallest positive ratio**.
   * If no positive ratios exist → **Unbounded solution**.

3. **Pivot and Update:**
   Perform pivoting to update the tableau and iterate until optimality is achieved.

---

## **💡 Why is This Theorem Important?**

* **Ensures Feasibility:** Only feasible solutions are considered.
* **Guarantees Improvement:** Each pivot increases the objective value.
* **Stops Efficiently:** Once optimality conditions are met, the algorithm stops.

---

Would you like me to demonstrate how this theorem applies to the current simplex tableau?



Slide **14/22** focuses on the **Primal Simplex Method (2nd Phase)**, where we iteratively improve the solution while maintaining feasibility. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the process:

---

## **🔑 Key Concepts of the Primal Simplex Method:**

1. **Basis Transformations:**

   * At each step, we update the basis by introducing one new variable and removing one old variable.
   * This transformation keeps the system of equations equivalent while improving the objective value.

2. **Primal Feasibility:**

   * All components of the solution vector $x$ must be **non-negative** at every iteration.
   * This condition ensures that the solution remains valid throughout the process.

3. **Minimum Ratio Rule:**

   * When a variable enters the basis, we identify the leaving variable using the **minimum ratio test**:

     $$
     \text{Ratio} = \frac{\text{RHS}}{\text{Coefficient of Entering Variable}}
     $$
   * The **smallest positive ratio** determines which variable leaves the basis.

4. **Objective Growth:**

   * The objective value (**z**) increases only if we choose a column where the **reduced cost is negative**.
   * If no negative values remain in the z-row, we reach the **optimal solution**.

---

## **⚙️ Step-by-Step Process:**

1. **Choose Entering Variable (Pivot Column):**

   * Identify the most negative value in the **z-row** (reduced costs).
   * This variable enters the basis as it has the most potential to improve the objective.

2. **Choose Leaving Variable (Pivot Row):**

   * Apply the **minimum ratio rule**:

     $$
     \frac{x_B}{\text{Pivot Column Coefficient}}
     $$
   * Select the smallest positive ratio to maintain feasibility.
   * The corresponding basic variable leaves the basis.

3. **Perform Pivoting (Basis Transformation):**

   * Normalize the pivot row by dividing it by the pivot element.
   * Adjust other rows to make the pivot column zero, except for the pivot row itself.

4. **Update the Tableau:**

   * Replace the leaving variable with the entering variable.
   * Recalculate the z-row and the right-hand side (RHS).

5. **Check Optimality:**

   * If all reduced costs in the z-row are non-negative, the current solution is **optimal**.
   * If any reduced cost is negative, repeat the process.

| $z$   | 0     | -19   | -23   | -15   | -42   | -33   | 0     | 0     | 0     | 1   |

* **Entering variable:** $x_4$ (most negative in the z-row: $-42$)
* **Leaving variable:** $s_1$ (minimum ratio: $24/3 = 8$)
* **Pivot element:** $3$

After pivoting, the new tableau reflects the updated solution.

## **📈 Why Does This Method Work?**

1. **Feasibility:** Non-negativity of all variables ensures the solution remains valid.
2. **Dual Feasibility:** Negative reduced costs indicate potential improvement.
3. **Optimality:** Once all reduced costs are non-negative, the solution is optimal.

---

## **🚀 Claim:**

The Simplex Method **always terminates** if performed correctly. It is **finite** and usually converges quickly, unless the problem involves degeneracy or cycling.

---

Would you like me to demonstrate the pivoting process for the current tableau step by step?



Slide **15/22** presents a key claim about the Simplex Method:

**Claim:**
The Simplex Method is **finite** (if performed "smartly").
It usually ends **quickly**, provided degeneracy and cycling are avoided.

---

## **🔍 Why is the Simplex Method Finite?**

1. **Linear Nature of the Problem:**

   * The feasible region of a linear programming problem is a **convex polyhedron**.
   * Each vertex (corner point) of the feasible region corresponds to a **basic feasible solution (BFS)**.
   * The Simplex Method moves from one vertex to an adjacent one, following the edges of the polyhedron.

2. **Pivoting Process:**

   * Each pivot improves the objective function or maintains feasibility.
   * A variable enters the basis (improving profit), and another leaves the basis (maintaining feasibility).
   * Since the number of vertices is **finite**, the process must eventually reach an optimal vertex.

3. **Objective Function Growth:**

   * In **maximization problems**, the objective value increases with each iteration.
   * In **minimization problems**, the objective value decreases with each iteration.
   * Once there are no negative reduced costs (z-row), the solution is **optimal**.

4. **Boundedness of the Problem:**

   * If the feasible region is **bounded**, the method always finds an optimal solution or determines infeasibility.
   * If unbounded, the method identifies it through the absence of positive pivot ratios.

---

## **💡 What Does "Smartly" Mean?**

1. **Avoiding Degeneracy:**

   * Degeneracy occurs when a basic variable takes a value of zero.
   * This can lead to cycling (repeating the same solutions).
   * **Anti-cycling rules** (like Bland's Rule) prevent infinite loops.

2. **Efficient Pivot Selection:**

   * Choose the **most negative reduced cost** as the entering variable (Primal Simplex).
   * Apply the **minimum ratio rule** to select the leaving variable.

3. **Numerical Precision:**

   * Avoid rounding errors, which can cause the method to iterate indefinitely.

---

## **📈 Why Does It Usually End "Soon"?**

1. **Exponential Possibilities, Linear Behavior:**

   * Though there are **exponentially many vertices**, the Simplex Method typically visits only a **small fraction**.
   * In practice, it behaves **linearly** for most real-world problems.

2. **Efficient Path:**

   * The method moves along the **edges of the feasible region**, avoiding interior points.
   * This **direct path** reduces the number of iterations.

---

## **🚀 Conclusion:**

* **Finite:** The method stops after visiting a finite number of vertices.
* **Efficient:** In practice, it usually converges quickly unless cycling occurs.
* **Smart:** Using anti-cycling strategies and accurate computations ensures rapid termination.

---

Would you like me to demonstrate an example where the method terminates efficiently, or explain how degeneracy can slow it down?




Let's break down the process described in **Slide 15/22**, where the **minimum rule** is applied in the Simplex Method. This rule helps decide which variable leaves the basis when a new variable enters.

---

## **🔍 What is Happening Here?**

1. **Entering Variable:**

   * The column $a_2$ (corresponding to $x_2$) is chosen as the **entering variable** because it has the **most negative reduced cost** in the z-row.
   * This means increasing $x_2$ will improve the objective value.

2. **Minimum Rule (Leaving Variable):**
   To maintain feasibility, we must determine which basic variable will **leave the basis**.

   * For each row, calculate the **ratio**:

     $$
     \frac{\text{RHS (Basic Solution Value)}}{\text{Coefficient of Entering Variable}}
     $$
   * In this case, the two rows being evaluated are:

$$
\frac{24}{2} = 12, \quad \frac{43}{1} = 43
$$

* Here:

  * **24:** Current value of the basic variable $u_1$.
  * **2:** Coefficient of the entering variable $a_2$ in the first constraint.
  * **43:** Current value of the basic variable $u_2$.
  * **1:** Coefficient of the entering variable $a_2$ in the second constraint.

3. **Choose the Smallest Positive Ratio:**

   * Compare the ratios:

     $$
     \min\left(\frac{24}{2}, \frac{43}{1}\right) = \min(12, 43) = 12
     $$

   * The **smallest ratio** identifies the **limiting constraint**, meaning the first resource (corresponding to $u_1$) is the bottleneck.

   * Therefore, **$u_1$ leaves the basis**, and **$a_2$ (x₂)** enters the basis.

4. **Pivot Element:**

   * The **pivot element** is the value at the intersection of the entering column ($a_2$) and the leaving row ($u_1$).
   * Here, the pivot element is **2**, which is written in bold in the tableau.

---

## **⚙️ Why Does This Work?**

* The **minimum ratio rule** ensures that the solution remains **feasible** after the entering variable increases.
* **Why not divide by zero or negative?**

  * A zero denominator would indicate that increasing the entering variable has **no impact** on that constraint.
  * A negative denominator would suggest an **unbounded solution**, meaning the objective can increase indefinitely.

---

## **📝 What Happens Next?**

1. **Normalize Pivot Row:**

   * Divide the entire pivot row by the pivot element (2).
   * This makes the pivot element equal to **1**.

2. **Update Other Rows:**

   * Adjust the other rows by subtracting appropriate multiples of the pivot row.
   * This ensures that the new entering variable has a **coefficient of zero** in all other rows.

3. **New Tableau:**

   * $a_2$ replaces $u_1$ in the basis.
   * The objective value increases, moving closer to optimality.

---

## **💡 Why Is This Important?**

1. **Feasibility:** Ensures that all basic variables remain non-negative.
2. **Optimality:** Moves towards a solution that improves the objective value.
3. **Finite Process:** Continues until no negative reduced costs remain in the z-row.

---

Would you like me to demonstrate this pivoting step with the updated tableau?





Let's break down the process described in **Slide 16/22**, which explains how to perform the **basis transformation** during the Simplex Method. This step involves updating the simplex tableau after identifying the pivot element.

---

## **🔍 1. What is Basis Transformation?**

Basis transformation updates the system of equations to reflect the new basis after pivoting. This ensures that the solution remains feasible while improving the objective value.

**Key actions:**

1. Normalize the pivot row.
2. Adjust all other rows (including the objective row) to zero out the pivot column.

---

## **⚙️ 2. Step-by-Step Process:**

### **Step 1: Identify the Pivot Element**

* The pivot element is **2**, located at the intersection of the entering variable $a_2$ (x₂) and the leaving variable $u_1$.

---

### **Step 2: Normalize Pivot Row (Row of $u_1$)**

* **Divide the entire pivot row by the pivot value (2).**

Original row:

$$
u_1: 1x_1 + 2x_2 + 1x_3 + 3x_4 + s_1 = 24
$$

Divide by 2:

$$
u_1: \frac{1}{2}x_1 + 1x_2 + \frac{1}{2}x_3 + \frac{3}{2}x_4 + \frac{1}{2}s_1 = 12
$$

---

### **Step 3: Update Other Rows (Row Operations)**

Now, adjust the other rows to make the pivot column zero:

1. **Second Row (u₂):**

   * Coefficient of $a_2$ is **1**.
   * Multiply the pivot row by $1/2$ and subtract from the second row:

$$
u_2 = u_2 - \frac{1}{2} \times u_1
$$

Calculation:

$$
43 - (1/2 \times 24) = 43 - 12 = 31
$$

Updated second row:

$$
u_2: -\frac{1}{2}x_1 + 0x_2 + \frac{1}{2}x_3 + \frac{7}{2}x_4 + 1s_2 - \frac{1}{2}s_1 = 31
$$

---

2. **Third Row (u₃):**

   * Coefficient of $a_2$ is **0**.
   * Multiply the pivot row by $0/2 = 0$ and subtract from the third row:

$$
u_3 = u_3 - 0 \times u_1
$$

Thus, the third row remains unchanged:

$$
u_3: 1x_1 + 0x_2 + 0x_3 + 2x_4 + 2x_5 + 0s_1 = 18
$$

---

3. **Objective Row (z-row):**

   * Coefficient of $a_2$ is **-23**.
   * Multiply the pivot row by $23/2$ and add to the z-row:

$$
z = z + \frac{23}{2} \times u_1
$$

Calculation:

$$
0 + (23/2 \times 24) = 276
$$

Updated objective row:

$$
z: -\frac{15}{2}x_1 + 0x_2 - \frac{7}{2}x_3 - \frac{15}{2}x_4 - 33x_5 + \frac{23}{2}s_1 = 276
$$

---

## **📊 3. Updated Tableau:**

After performing the basis transformation, the new simplex tableau looks like this:

| **B** | $x_B$ | $x_1$ | $x_2$ | $x_3$ | $x_4$ | $x_5$ | $s_1$ | $s_2$ | $s_3$ | $z$ |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | --- |
| $a_2$ | 12    | 1/2   | 1     | 1/2   | 3/2   | 0     | 1/2   | 0     | 0     | 0   |
| $u_2$ | 31    | -1/2  | 0     | 1/2   | 7/2   | 1     | -1/2  | 1     | 0     | 0   |
| $u_3$ | 18    | 1     | 0     | 0     | 2     | 2     | 0     | 0     | 1     | 0   |
| $z$   | 276   | -15/2 | 0     | -7/2  | -15/2 | -33   | 23/2  | 0     | 0     | 1   |

---

## **💡 4. Why is This Important?**

1. **Normalization:** The pivot element becomes **1**, ensuring the new entering variable is correctly scaled.
2. **Zeroing Out:** The pivot column becomes zero in all non-pivot rows, maintaining linear independence.
3. **Improvement:** The objective value increases from **0** to **276**, moving towards optimality.

---

## **🚀 5. Next Steps:**

1. Check the z-row for negative reduced costs.
2. If negative values remain, repeat the process with the next entering variable.
3. Continue until all reduced costs are non-negative, indicating the **optimal solution**.

---

Would you like me to demonstrate the next iteration or explain how this transformation ensures feasibility and optimality?




Let's break down what happens when $a_5$ enters the basis and $u_3$ leaves the basis in the next iteration of the Simplex Method.

---

## **🔑 What’s Happening?**

1. **Entering Variable:**

   * $a_5$ (corresponding to $x_5$) enters the basis.
   * This is chosen because its **reduced cost is negative** in the z-row, indicating that increasing $x_5$ will further improve the objective value.

2. **Leaving Variable (Minimum Rule):**

   * Apply the **minimum ratio test** to find the leaving variable:

     $$
     \text{Ratio} = \frac{\text{RHS}}{\text{Coefficient of Entering Variable (x_5)}}
     $$

   * From the tableau:

| **B** | $x_B$ (RHS) | $x_1$ | $x_2$ | $x_3$ | $x_4$ | $x_5$ | $s_1$ | $s_2$ | $s_3$ |
| ----- | ----------- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| $a_2$ | 12          | 1/2   | 1     | 1/2   | 3/2   | 0     | 1/2   | 0     | 0     |
| $u_2$ | 31          | -1/2  | 0     | 1/2   | 7/2   | 1     | -1/2  | 1     | 0     |
| $u_3$ | 18          | 1     | 0     | 0     | 2     | 2     | 0     | 0     | 1     |

* Calculate the ratio for each row:

  $$
  \frac{12}{0} = \infty, \quad \frac{31}{1} = 31, \quad \frac{18}{2} = 9
  $$

* The **smallest positive ratio** is **9**, so **$u_3$ leaves the basis**.

---

## **⚙️ Pivoting:**

* **Pivot Element:** $2$ (intersection of $a_5$ and $u_3$ row).
* **Normalize Pivot Row:** Divide the entire $u_3$ row by **2**:

$$
u_3: \frac{1}{2} x_1 + 0 x_2 + 0 x_3 + 1 x_4 + 1 x_5 + 0 s_1 + 0 s_2 + \frac{1}{2} s_3 = 9
$$

---

## **📊 Updated Tableau (After Pivoting):**

| **B** | $x_B$ | $x_1$ | $x_2$ | $x_3$ | $x_4$ | $x_5$ | $s_1$ | $s_2$ | $s_3$ |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| $a_2$ | 12    | 1/2   | 1     | 1/2   | 3/2   | 0     | 1/2   | 0     | 0     |
| $u_2$ | 31    | -1/2  | 0     | 1/2   | 7/2   | 1     | -1/2  | 1     | 0     |
| $a_5$ | 9     | 1/2   | 0     | 0     | 1     | 1     | 0     | 0     | 1/2   |

---

## **📝 Objective Row Update:**

Adjust the z-row based on the pivot transformation.

Original z-row:

$$
z = 276 - 33 x_5
$$

Since $x_5$ enters the basis, update the z-row by adding **33 times** the new pivot row ($a_5$):

$$
z = 276 + 33 \times 9 = 573
$$

Updated z-row:

$$
z: 573 + 9 x_1 - 7/2 x_3 + 51/2 x_4 + 23/2 s_1 + 33/2 s_3
$$

---

## **💡 Why This Matters:**

1. **Feasibility:** The solution remains feasible with all basic variables non-negative.
2. **Optimality:** The objective value increased from **276 to 573**.
3. **Next Step:** Check the z-row for negative reduced costs. Since one negative value remains, another iteration is required.

---

Would you like me to demonstrate the next iteration or explain how this transformation moves closer to the optimal solution?




Let's continue with the next iteration of the Simplex Method, as described in **Slide 16/22**, where the **last negative entry in the z-row** determines the next pivot operation.

---

## **🔍 Current Tableau (After Previous Iteration):**

| **B** | $x_B$ | $x_1$ | $x_2$ | $x_3$ | $x_4$ | $x_5$ | $s_1$ | $s_2$ | $s_3$ |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| $a_2$ | 12    | 1/2   | 1     | 1/2   | 3/2   | 0     | 1/2   | 0     | 0     |
| $u_2$ | 31    | -1/2  | 0     | 1/2   | 7/2   | 1     | -1/2  | 1     | 0     |
| $a_5$ | 9     | 1/2   | 0     | 0     | 1     | 1     | 0     | 0     | 1/2   |

**Objective row (z-row):**

$$
z = 573 + 9 x_1 - \frac{7}{2} x_3 + \frac{51}{2} x_4 + \frac{23}{2} s_1 + \frac{33}{2} s_3
$$

---

## **1. Entering Variable:**

* The **last negative entry** in the z-row is **-7/2** (corresponding to $x_3$).
* Therefore, **$x_3$ enters the basis**.

---

## **2. Leaving Variable (Minimum Ratio Test):**

Calculate the ratio for each row where the coefficient of $x_3$ is positive:

| **B** | $x_B$ (RHS) | $x_3$ Coefficient | **Ratio (RHS / x₃ Coefficient)** |
| ----- | ----------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------- |
| $a_2$ | 12          | 1/2               | $\frac{12}{1/2} = 24$            |
| $u_2$ | 31          | 1/2               | $\frac{31}{1/2} = 62$            |
| $a_5$ | 9           | 0                 | Not applicable                   |

* The **smallest positive ratio** is **24**, so **$a_2$ leaves the basis**.

---

## **3. Pivoting (Basis Transformation):**

* **Pivot element:** $1/2$, located at the intersection of $x_3$ and $a_2$.
* **Normalize the pivot row:** Divide Row 1 by $1/2$ (multiply by 2):

$$
x_3 = 24, \quad x_1 + 2 x_2 + x_3 + 3 x_4 + s_1 = 24
$$

Divide by $1/2$:

$$
x_3 = 24, \quad x_1 + 2 x_2 + 2 x_3 + 3 x_4 + s_1 = 24
$$

New normalized pivot row (for $x_3$):

$$
x_3: 1 x_1 + 2 x_2 + 1 x_3 + 3 x_4 + 2 s_1 = 24
$$

---

## **4. Update Other Rows (Row Operations):**

### **Row 2 (u₂):**

* Subtract $\frac{1}{2} \times$ (new pivot row) from Row 2:

$$
u_2 = u_2 - \frac{1}{2} \times x_3
$$

Calculation:

$$
31 - \frac{1}{2} \times 24 = 31 - 12 = 19
$$

New Row 2:

$$
u_2: -1 x_1 - 1 x_2 + 0 x_3 + 1 x_4 + 0 s_1 = 19
$$

---

### **Row 3 (a₅):**

* No change in the $x_3$ column, as its coefficient is **0**.

---

### **Objective Row (z-row):**

* Adjust the z-row using the pivot row:

$$
z = z + \frac{7}{2} \times x_3
$$

Calculation:

$$
573 + \frac{7}{2} \times 24 = 573 + 84 = 657
$$

New z-row:

$$
z = 657 + 25/2 x_1 + 7 x_2 + 0 x_3 + 36 x_4 + 15 s_1
$$

---

## **5. Updated Tableau (After Pivoting):**

| **B** | $x_B$ | $x_1$ | $x_2$ | $x_3$ | $x_4$ | $x_5$ | $s_1$ | $s_2$ | $s_3$ |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| $x_3$ | 24    | 1     | 2     | 1     | 3     | 0     | 1     | 0     | 0     |
| $u_2$ | 19    | -1    | -1    | 0     | 1     | 0     | 0     | 1     | 0     |
| $a_5$ | 9     | 1/2   | 0     | 0     | 1     | 1     | 0     | 0     | 1/2   |

---

## **6. Optimal Solution Check:**

* **Objective Value:** $z = 657$
* **Decision Variables:**

  * $x_3 = 24$, $x_5 = 9$, $x_1 = 0$, $x_2 = 0$, $x_4 = 0$
* **Remaining Resources:** $u_2 = 10$

Since **no negative entries remain in the z-row**, the current solution is **optimal**.

---

## **✅ Final Optimal Solution:**

1. **Production Plan:**

   * Produce **24 units of P3** and **9 units of P5**.
   * Do not produce **P1, P2, or P4**.

2. **Resource Usage:**

   * **Res1:** Fully used.
   * **Res2:** 10 units remain unused.
   * **Res3:** Fully used.

3. **Maximum Profit:**

$$
z_{\text{opt}} = 657
$$

---

## **💡 Why Does This Matter?**

1. **Feasibility:** All basic variables are non-negative.
2. **Optimality:** No negative reduced costs remain.
3. **Efficiency:** The process terminated after 3 pivot operations.

Would you like a further breakdown of how the final solution was confirmed or explore sensitivity analysis?




Let's break down the **rule of the change of the objective function** as described in the slide. This rule determines how the choice of the entering variable affects the objective value during the Simplex Method.

---

## **🔑 Key Insights of the Rule:**

1. **Negative Value in the Objective Row (z-row):**

   * If we choose a column with a **negative value** in the z-row (reduced cost), the objective value will **increase** after pivoting.
   * This is because a negative reduced cost means that increasing the corresponding variable will **improve the objective**.
   * **Example:**
     If the z-row has $-42$ under $x_4$, increasing $x_4$ improves the profit.

---

2. **Positive Value in the Objective Row (z-row):**

   * If we choose a column with a **positive value** in the z-row, the objective value will **decrease** after pivoting.
   * Since the goal is to **maximize** the objective, this is **undesirable**.
   * **Example:**
     If the z-row has $+10$ under $x_2$, increasing $x_2$ would reduce the profit.

---

3. **Zero Value in the Objective Row (z-row):**

   * If we choose a column with a **zero value** in the z-row, the objective value **remains unchanged**.
   * This implies the entering variable does not affect the objective value.
   * **Example:**
     If the z-row has $0$ under $x_5$, increasing $x_5$ will neither increase nor decrease the profit.

---

## **📈 Why Does This Rule Matter?**

1. **Efficiency:** Choosing the most negative reduced cost ensures faster convergence to the optimal solution.
2. **Feasibility:** The minimum ratio test ensures that feasibility is maintained after the entering variable increases.
3. **Optimality:** The method stops when all reduced costs are non-negative, ensuring the objective value cannot increase further.

---

## **🚀 Conclusion:**

1. Choose **negative reduced costs** → Objective **increases**. ✅
2. Choose **positive reduced costs** → Objective **decreases**. ❌
3. Choose **zero reduced costs** → **No change** in the objective. ⚖️

Would you like me to demonstrate how this rule applied in the final tableau of your problem?




Let's break down what the slide means regarding **degeneracy** and how it affects the Simplex Method.

---

## **🔑 What is Degeneracy in Simplex?**

A **basic solution** is called **non-degenerate** if all basic variables (those in the basis) are **strictly positive**. In contrast, **degeneracy** occurs when one or more basic variables take a value of **zero**.

**Example:**
If the current basis is $B(a_2, u_2, a_5)$, then the corresponding variables $x_2, s_2, x_5$ should all be **positive** for the solution to be **non-degenerate**.

---

## **⚙️ Why Does Degeneracy Matter?**

1. **Non-Degenerate Solution:**

   * All basic variables are positive.
   * The pivot operation results in an **improvement** in the objective value.
   * Each iteration **moves closer to optimality**.

2. **Degenerate Solution:**

   * At least one basic variable is **zero**.
   * During the pivot operation, the **minimum ratio test** results in a tie.
   * This causes the **objective value to remain unchanged**, leading to the risk of:

     * **Cycling:** Repeating the same basis without progress.
     * **Stagnation:** No improvement in the objective value.

---

## **💡 Why No Change in the Objective?**

* If the pivot element is associated with a **zero-valued variable**, increasing the entering variable cannot increase the objective.
* In such cases, the column of the basic solution remains **unchanged**, and the objective function does not improve.
* This happens because the system moves to a **new vertex** of the feasible region, but the **objective function remains flat** at that point.

---

## **📈 Example from the Problem:**

In the previous iterations, the pivot operations changed the objective value because the basic variables were positive. However, if any row had a **zero value in the RHS**, pivoting would not change the objective.

For example, if $u_2 = 0$ during the pivot step, increasing the entering variable would **not improve the profit**, as it would hit the boundary of the feasible region without moving further.

---

## **🚀 How to Handle Degeneracy:**

1. **Bland's Rule:** Always choose the smallest-indexed variable to enter the basis.
2. **Anti-Cycling Techniques:** Prioritize pivots that lead to positive changes.
3. **Perturbation Method:** Add small positive values to avoid zero coefficients.

## **✅ Conclusion:**

* **Non-degenerate:** Basic variables $x_2, s_2, x_5 > 0$ → Objective increases.
* **Degenerate:** One basic variable $= 0$ → No change in the objective.

### **🚀 Summary of the Primal Simplex Method**

The **Primal Simplex Method** is an iterative algorithm used to solve linear programming problems by transforming the basis while maintaining feasibility. Here’s a clear breakdown of the process:

---

## **🔑 Key Steps:**

1. **Basis Transformations:**

   * At each iteration, one non-basic variable enters the basis, and one basic variable leaves.
   * This transformation ensures that the system of equations remains consistent.

2. **Primal Feasibility:**

   * Ensure that all variables in the solution remain **non-negative** ($x \geq 0$).
   * This guarantees that the solution remains valid throughout the process.

3. **Choosing the Entering Variable:**

   * Look at the **reduced costs** (z-row).
   * **Choose the most negative value** → This indicates the direction to improve the objective.
   * This ensures that the objective value **increases** (for maximization problems).

4. **Choosing the Leaving Variable (Minimum Ratio Rule):**

   * Apply the **minimum ratio test**:

     $$
     \text{Ratio} = \frac{\text{RHS (Current Solution)}}{\text{Coefficient of Entering Variable}}
     $$
   * Choose the **smallest positive ratio** → This ensures feasibility after the entering variable increases.

5. **Pivoting (Basis Transformation):**

   * Normalize the pivot row by dividing by the pivot element.
   * Adjust other rows to make the pivot column zero.
   * Update the z-row and the RHS values.

---

## **✅ Optimality Conditions:**

1. **No Negative Reduced Costs (z-row):**

   * If there are **no negative entries** in the objective row (z-row), the solution satisfies **dual feasibility**.

2. **Primal Feasibility:**

   * All variables in the basis remain **non-negative** ($x \geq 0$).

3. **Optimality Achieved:**

   * Once **both primal and dual feasibility** hold simultaneously, the solution is **optimal**.

---

## **📈 Why It Works:**

1. **Improvement:** Each pivot improves the objective value.
2. **Feasibility:** Ensures that the solution remains valid.
3. **Efficiency:** Terminates once no negative reduced costs remain.

---

## **🚀 Conclusion:**

1. **Choose negative reduced cost → Objective increases.**
2. **Maintain primal feasibility → Solution remains valid.**
3. **No negative z-row values → Optimal solution reached.**

---

Would you like a final walk-through of the last iteration to see how these conditions were achieved?




Here's the pseudocode for the **Primal Simplex Algorithm**, followed by a C++ program that implements it.

---

## **🔍 Pseudocode of Primal Simplex Algorithm**

```
Input: Coefficient matrix A, RHS vector b, Objective coefficients c
Output: Optimal solution x and maximum objective value z

1. Initialize:
   - Form the initial simplex tableau with slack variables.
   - Identify basic and non-basic variables.

2. Repeat until optimality is reached:
   a. Check the z-row (reduced costs):
      - If all reduced costs are ≥ 0 → Optimal solution found. Exit loop.
      - Otherwise, select the most negative reduced cost as the entering variable.

   b. Apply the minimum ratio rule:
      - For each row, calculate: Ratio = RHS / Coefficient of entering variable
      - Choose the row with the smallest positive ratio → Leaving variable.

   c. Perform Pivoting:
      - Normalize the pivot row (divide by pivot element).
      - Adjust other rows to zero out the entering variable column.

3. Update the tableau and repeat until no negative reduced costs remain.

4. Output the optimal solution and the objective value.
